# LeafCLIP: Vision-Language Model for Leaf Disease Diagnosis

LeafCLIP is a powerful vision-language model built on top of Swin-B (as the vision encoder) and SigLIP2 (as the text encoder), 
fine-tuned on LeafNetV2, a comprehensive dataset of over 255,000 image-text pairs spanning 197 classes of crop leaf diseases.
The model is designed to bring interpretability and efficiency to smart agriculture by enabling multi-modal learning from both 
images and their natural language descriptions
